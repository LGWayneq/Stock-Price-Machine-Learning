# Stock Price Machine Learning
 
This project aimed to identify the most suitable and optimal machine learning models to help potential investors to predict stock prices. Python libraries and packages that we used include Pandas, seaborn, 

Through this project, we understood the complexities behind predicting stock prices, due to limitations of time-series data, as well as many uncertainties in the market. While we ultimately identified LSTM to be a suitable model for predicting stock price, there is still much room for error when it comes to predicting something as volatile as the stock market.
